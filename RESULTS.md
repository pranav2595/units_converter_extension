## Methods
#### Data Collection: Google Form
1. Experience in coding.
2. Familiarity with project.
3. Ease of understanding the project.
4. Ease of setup and use.
5. Total time taken for setup and usage.

#### Data Colelction BTS: Behind The Scenes
1. Time taken to convert some random units without extension.
2. Time to convert the same random units now with extension.

## Materials
The experiment was conducted with the help of:
1. Zoom: For conducting 15-30 minutes session with each participant.
2. Google Form: To anonymously capture experiment results/opinions from each participant.
3. Google Sheet: Observations from our side with respect to each participant.

## Threats to Validity
The following were observed to be change points for the next testing and validation runs:
1. Unstructured data collection:
   
   Initially, data collection was facilitated using several means and data collation was a huge problem bound to happen. We quickly fixed a central evaluation form, but this is a change point to be kept in mind - to have a structured data collection methodology.
   
2. Insufficient data collection:
   
   Testers might have found varying degrees of difficulty to try and debug the code since the bugs introduced were not uniform, similar or of the same quality. Hence, as testers progressed through the debugging session, they might have felt varying levels of difficulty in a very small amount of time affecting the level of code they wrote.

3. Helper files or functions:
    
    To people new to a certain language chosen, we could have added a helper file to run and get their concepts in shape before asking them to dive right into debugging a code written in a fairly unintuitive language for many testers. This is another point to keep in mind for our further testing iterations.

4. Cleaner install and easier process:

    Writing the entire, correct procedure in a concise manner in the github README.md would definitely might have helped with the experiment. 
  
In general, writing cleaner code, helper files and a pin-pointed README will help in the future experiments.
